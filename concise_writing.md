# Six Steps to More Concise Writing

Techniques are duplicated from [edX - How to Write an Essay](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:BerkeleyX+ColWri2.1x+1T2021/home), thanks to *Maggie Sokolik, Ph.D., Instructor*.

## Step 1. Avoid redundancy

They say the same thing as the main phrase.

* ten p.m. (at night)
* tall (in height)
* our (final) conclusion
* (the month of) June
* square (in shape)
* to combine (together)
* to ask (a question)
* a consensus (of opinion)

## Step 2. Avoid wordy phrases

You use more words than you need to say something.

| Wordy                     | Concise     |
| ------------------------- | ----------- |
| based on the fact that    | because     |
| despite the fact that     | although    |
| in the event that         | if          |
| at the present time       | now         |
| until such a time as      | until       |
| on a weekly basis         | weekly      |
| it is often the case that | often       |
| have the ability to       | can         |
| during the course of      | during      |
| take under consideration  | consider    |
| to be of the opinion      | to think    |
| to make reference to      | to refer to |
| in the final analysis     | finally     |

## Step 3. Clear subject and no empty subject

* Unclear: **The practice of revision** would improve our writing.
* Clear: **Revision** would improve our writing.

---

* Empty: **There is** no way to become a better writer than to practice.
* Defined: **We** can become better writers if we practice.

## Step 4. Using strong verbs

* to be + nouns: **What we found was a solution** to the problem.
* Strong verb: We **solved** the problem.

## Step 5. Avoid vague words

Words like "thing," "stuff," "material," "people," "get," or "did" should be replaced with precise nouns or verbs.

* Vague: I needed to get **some stuff** at **the store**.
* Clear: I needed to buy **some groceries** at the **farmer's market**.

## Step 6. Remove unnecessary modifiers.

Look for modifiers like "many," "really," "quite," "in my opinion," and so on, and edit them out of your writing.

* Unnecessary: **In my opinion,** that movie was **really quite good**. I'm **very** glad we saw it.
* Concise: That movie was **fantastic**! I'm **glad** we saw it.

## Bonus. Strengthen your sentences

If the revision of that sentence sounds too simple, think of other ways to modify it that add information. 

| Level              | Sentence                                                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unnecessary        | In my opinion, that movie was really quite good.            |
| Concise            | That movie was fantastic!                                   |
| Adding Information | That movie was an interesting retelling of a familiar story |
