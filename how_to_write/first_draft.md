## ATTRIBUTION

- **The names of the authors, with all initials; the Institute or organisation, with full address; the date**. For example:

“A.M.Harte and C.Chen,
The Cambridge Centre for Micromechanics,

January 1999.”

## THE ABSTRACT

- **Try for one sentence each on motive, method, key results, conclusions**
- **Don’t exceed 3 sentences on any one**

## INTRODUCTION

- **What is the problem and why is it interesting?**
- **Who are the main contributors?**
- **What did they do?**
- **What novel thing will you reveal?**

> Outline the problem and why it was worth tackling. Review the literature, recording briefly the main contributors and summarising the status of the field when you started the research. 
> 
> Provide any specialised information that the reader might need if he is to understand what follows. State what you will do that has not been done before (new experimental approach? new data? new model? new interpretation?) Keep it as brief as you can whilst still doing all this.

## METHOD

- **Experimental paper**: equipment, materials, method
- **Modelling paper**: assumptions, mathematical tools, method
- **Computational paper**: inputs, computational tools, method

---

- **Explain what is especially different about your method.**
- **Give sufficient detail that the reader can reproduce what you did.**
- **Don’t mix Method with Results or Discussion—they come next.**

> This should be an easy section to write: just say what you did, succinctly. Use “we” but do so sparingly: too many “we’s” sounds like a child’s day out: “first we did this, then we did that.”

## RESULTS

- **Present the output of the experiments, model or computation**
- **Don’t mix Results with Discussion.**

> Give emphasis in the text the most important aspects of the tables, graphs or figures. Give error-bars or confidence-limits for numerical or graphical data.
> Aim for a concise, economical style:

| Shear loading fractures cell-walls (Figure 3). | It is clearly shown in Figure 3 that the shear loading had caused the cell-walls to suffer ductile fracture or possibly brittle failure. |

## DISCUSSION

- **Extract principles, relationships, generalisations.**
- **Present analysis, model or theory.**
- **Show relationship between the results and analysis, model or theory.**

> Here you are seeking to extract principles, relationships, or generalisations from the results. Sometimes the results speak for themselves.

| The novel heat-treatment described in Section 2 gives steels which are 10% stronger and 20% tougher than those heat-treated in the normal way. |

## CONCLUSION

- **Draw together the most important results and their consequences.**
- **List any reservations or limitations.**

> The reader scanning your paper will read the Abstract and the Conclusions, glance at the Figures and move on. Do not duplicate the Abstract as the Conclusions or vice versa. 
> 
> The Abstract is an overview of the entire paper. The Conclusions are a summing up of the advances in knowledge that have emerged from it 

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

- **Thank people who have helped you with ideas, technical assistance, materials or finance.**

> Keep it simple, give full names and affiliation, and don’t get sentimental. A formula such as this works well.
