## Be clear

Use simple language and simple, concise construction; short words rather than long; familiar words, not obscure. **AND DON’T WAFFLE.** Consider this, from a well-known Materials text:

> “The selection of the proper material is a key step in the design process because it is the crucial decision that links computer
calculations and the lines on an engineering drawing with a real or working design”.

What does it say? **“Materials selection is important”**, and we knew that already. It is wasting the reader’s time

## Write from an appropriate design

Poor writing lacks order, mixes ideas that should develop separately, fails to progress in a logical sequence. Remember who you are writing for. Tell them what they want to know, not what they know already or do not want to know

## Define everything

Define all symbols and abbreviations.

1. The mass m scales as E/ρ where E is Youngs’s modulus and ρ is the density… leaving a double space on either side of a symbol when it appears in the text.
2. The measurements, made with a scanning electron microscope (SEM), … (allows you to use the abbreviation SEM thereafter.)

## Avoid empty words

| Bad                                                                    | Reason                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *very, rather, somewhat, quite…*                                       | Avoid weak qualifiers                                                                  |
| *This very important point* …                                          | **makes less impact than**: *This important point* … **or, more simply**: *This point* |
| *The agreement with theory is quite good*                              | **makes the reader suggests that it is not**.                                          |
| *These ideas could rather easily be extended to the non-linear case* … | **makes the reader wonder why you didn’t do it**.                                      |

## Revise and rewrite

Revising is part of writing. Nobody gets it right first time; some go through 8 or 10 drafts. 

## Do not overstate, over emphasise or apologise

All of these undermine the reader’s confidence in your judgment.

| Bad                                                                            | Reason                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *This paper questions the basic assumptions of fracture mechanics...*          | fills the reader with mistrust; after all, fracture mechanics works.                   |
| *This very important result…., This significant finding…*                      | are better replaced by the simpler *This result…* and *This finding…*                  |
| *Unfortunately, there was insufficient time to complete the last set of tests* | never, ever, apologise, make the reader suggests bad planning, laziness, incompetence. |

## Avoid being patronising, condescending or eccentric

| Bad                                           | Reason                 |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| *The amazingly perceptive comment by Fleck …* | Don’t patronise        |
| *Readers familiar with my work will know …*   | Don’t be condescending |

## Use appropriate language

Use standard symbols and terms. Minimise the use of acronyms and abbreviations.

| Bad                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The MEM, analysed by FE methods, was photographed by SEM and chemically characterised by SAM |

## Good first sentence

**Don’t start introductions (or anything else) with platitudes. Tell the reader something he does not already know.**

Openings such as: *It is widely accepted that X (your topic) is important …* has the **reader yawning before you’ve started**. Try to get a new fact, new idea or a revealing comparison into the first line

| Poor Opening                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Reason                                                                                                                                                                              |

| *Metal foams are a new class of material attracting interest world-wide and with great potential… X, Y, Z have measured their strength properties …P, Q, and R have developed theoretical models … Comparison of the experiments with the models suggests that the measured strength are less than those predicted …* | The first sentences is a platitude; the second and third involve the reader in details, the relevance of which is not yet clear; only in the fourth does the point start to emerge. |


| Good Opening                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Reason                                                                                                                                        |

| *Metal foams are not as strong as they should be. Models, which describe polymer foams well, overestimate the strength of metal foams by factor of 2 to 5. This research explores the reasons. To be more specific… (details of literature X, Y, Z, P, Q, R here).* | The first two sentences now highlight the problem. The third says what the paper is going to do. The details that follow then have relevance. |

## Seek helpful examples and analogies

> One cause of rolling friction is material damping. A rolling ball deforms the surface on which it rolls. If the work done in this
deformation is lost through damping, a frictional force opposes motion. **It is like riding a bicycle through sand: the rubbing sand
particles dissipate energy much as atom or molecular rearrangements do.**

The bicycle analogy is appropriate; it relates the scientific problem to one which is familiar.

## Linking sentences

Each sentence in a paragraph should lead logically to the next. It helps the reader if one paragraph ends with a device that links it
to the next: a word or phrase picked up in the first sentence of the following paragraph, or a statement of what is coming next (though
be sparing with this, it can get tedious).

| Example                                                                                                                                                                             | Benefit                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ………To progress further, we need a way to rank the materials—a material index. A material index is a ……                                                                              | The **repeated words** link the two paragraphs.                        |
| ………This behaviour suggests that the process is diffusioncontrolled. A model based on this idea is developed next. The stresses at grain boundaries can be relaxed by diffusion. … | The reader knows what the second paragraph is about before reading it. |
