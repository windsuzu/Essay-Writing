# Essay

Essays can take many forms. However, we are dealing with academic essays in this course, and they do have certain expectations.

1. An introductory paragraph with a thesis statement that is arguable
2. Body paragraphs (no particular number, as few as two, but the upper limit is high)
3. A conclusion
4. A bibliography that cites the sources of information used in the essay

## Outlining techniques

We will explore some different ways of planning an essay.

### Informal Outlines

If you can label each part of your informal outline, that will be helpful in thinking about your overall organization.

This could be something as simple as a header and a bullet-list. For example:

```
# Introduction

- discuss background of book
- state my thesis 

# Part 1

- Give background information on the book
- Talk about its main argument
- Introduce the setting
```

### Formal Outlines

Formal outlines have more details than informal outlines, and formal outlines also use certain methods of showing relationships between ideas.

Formal outlines often use Roman numerals, but using Arabic numbers is perfectly acceptable.

After indicating the main sections of the essay, subparts are indicated with capital letters. We'll continue with the Arabic numeral example only:

```
1. Introduction
    A. Background Information
    B. Thesis
        a. Idea 1
        b. Idea 2
    C. Preview of Supporting Reasons
        a. Idea 1
        b. Idea 2

2. Main Body
    A. Main Point 1
    B. Main Point 2
```

## Creating strong introductions

Your introduction should make it clear to your reader what your essay is about, what your argument is, and what necessary background the reader needs to understand the topic. 

Review your introduction. Is your introduction inviting? Interesting? Does it make the reader want to continue reading?

## Creating strong Conclusions

Conclusions are also important. They remind the readers of your argument, and give them something to consider in their own thinking.

Review your conclusion. Are you leaving your reader with a positive feeling about your writing?

## Creating a Bibliography

A bibliography is a list of the sources that you consulted when you did research for your essay. Bibliographies are important for these reasons:

1. They acknowledge the source of information and the work of others.
2. Your readers can evaluate your sources to see if they are reliable, or even read some of your sources if they want to learn more.
3. They show that you have worked to provide evidence for your ideas.
4. They give the context and reasoning for the topic of your paper. 

## Avoiding Plagiarism

1. Copying from the internet **without** citing the source is **not** permitted.
2. You **still** need to use quotation marks when you quote a writer **even if** you write his or her name at the end of the paragraph.
3. Using some phrases from an article is plagiarism, **even when you mix them** with your own words.
4. The number of hours in a day is common knowledge and does not need to be cited.
5. If you quote a poem that is more than **100 years old**, you still **have to** cite it.
