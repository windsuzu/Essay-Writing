# Introduction to the Paragraph

In academic writing, paragraphs are often long. They usually include:

1. A **topic sentence**
2. One or more **body sentences** (supporting the topic sentence)
3. A **concluding sentence** (transitions to the next paragraph, or ends the essay)

Here is an example of academic paragraph:

> Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.

In academic writing, each sentence leads logically to the next, and is connected through **transition words** or other **connecting words**. In addition to a topic sentence and a main idea, an effective paragraph is **coherent** and **develops** its idea.

## Coherence

Coherence makes a paragraph understandable to a reader. You can create coherence in your paragraphs by using **logical** (each sentence in a paragraph relates in some way to the topic) and **verbal connections**:

- Repeat key words
- Use synonyms for key words
- Use pronouns to link sentences together
- Link sentences with transition words 

## Development

Development refers to the support you have for your topic sentence. A well-developed paragraph should have an adequate number of sentences to support the main idea. Here are some ways you can make sure your paragraphs are developed:

- Use examples 
- Give data (for example, statistics, data, information, examples)
- Quote others, either directly or through paraphrasing
- Tell a story
- Define your key words
- Compare or contrast ideas
- Examine causes and effects

---

Two other important pieces of academic paragraphs are **transitions** and **signposts**.  

## Signposts

In writing, a signpost helps readers find their way; it can be a phrase, sentence, or paragraph that explains to the reader **where the writer has been**, or where the writer is going. Here are some example signposts:

- The purpose of this paper is....
- The previous research has shown...
- The next section will illustrate...

## Transitions

Transitions are phrases or sentences that help you move from from one idea to the next. Transitions are often used **at the ends of paragraphs** to create a connection between ideas, **from one paragraph to the next**. Common transitions include:

- moreover
- nevertheless
- in addition
- similarly
- on the other hand
- in conclusion

We have many other words and phrases that you can use as transitions for different purposes. A page listing these words and their uses can be viewed at [Key phrases](../basics/key_phrases.md).

## Another Example

Read the following paragraph and see if you can locate the transitions.

> The concept of fairness is central to understanding plagiarism. Fairness means being fair both to yourself and others. Moreover, everybody both gives and receives their proper due, and nobody has anything to complain about. For example, an incident involving unfairness could be taking someone else’s work and saying it is your own. As a result, the person whose work has been taken receives no credit for their research and thinking. Furthermore, writers who plagiarize are not being fair to themselves because they are not developing their own independent academic skills. Therefore, students who do their own work with proper acknowledgment of the work of others develop their own academic skills and self-confidence far more than those who misuse the work of others.
