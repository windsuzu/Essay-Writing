# Thesis Statement

Thesis = TopicsðŸŽž + ArgumentðŸŽ¨

## Topics

A thesis first establishes the **topic** of your essay, example topics are:

- The hunting of wolves in the Arctic
- College entrance exams
- Hybrid automobiles

## Adding an Argument

In order to create a thesis, you have to add an opinion, or point of view that is **arguable**, examples are:

- *The hunting of wolves in the Arctic* **should be stopped because of the danger of the wolf's extinction**.
- *College entrance exams* **are not the best way to test a student's readiness for university study**. 

## Testing for a Good Thesis

One way to test if you have a good thesis is to ask whether someone could disagree with your point of view. For example:

- *The hunting of wolves in the Arctic* **should be stopped because of the danger of the wolf's extinction**.
- *The hunting of wolves in the Arctic* **should not be stopped because the population of wolves needs to be controlled**.

## Conclusion of Thesis Statements

A thesis generally has two parts: a statement of the topic, and an argument or position about that topic, the arguments are in one or two sentences.

Example: 

> Continuing changes in pension plans make it almost impossible to plan wisely for retirement.

- "Continuing changes in pension plans" = topic
- "Make it almost impossible to plan wisely for retirement" = argument

---

If you cannot think of an alternative thesis statement, chances are that you have an observation about your topic, or an argument for which no one would have an alternative explanation.

Look at these examples, and think about why they are not as effective:

> In the current economy, pension plans are changing. 

- This is true--but so what? Why is this interesting, important, or controversial?

> Jack London was the best American writer of his generation.

- This is too vague--what does "best" mean?

# What is not a Thesis Statement?

## A Fact or Observation is NOT a Thesis Statement

If you state something that is obvious, or that everyone accepts as a fact, you do not have a thesis.

Examples:

- In Moby Dick, Melville writes about a sailor named Ishmael.
- The largest country by land area is Russia, and the smallest is Vatican City.
- Philosophy is the study of knowledge and reality.

## An Explanation of the Subject is NOT a Thesis Statement

A thesis has a point of view. It has an opinion about the subject, but it is not the subject.

| Explanation                                                             | Thesis statement                                                                                                                                                |

| My thesis is about the best place to take a vacation.                   | The best place for a perfect vacation is Paris because of the beautiful architecture, wonderful restaurants, and abundance of museums.                          |
| I want to share some of my ideas about education.                       | By narrowing the educational gap between the wealthy and the underprivileged, everyone can have an equal chance to become successful and contribute to society. |
| The topic of this paper is the effect of video games on young children. | Children should be prevented from playing video games for more than an hour a day, as it may keep them from developing their creativity.                        |
