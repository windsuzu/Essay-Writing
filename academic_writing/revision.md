# 8-Point Checklist for Revision

1. Does your essay have one clear and concise main idea? Is this idea addressed in a good, arguable thesis statement?
2. Does your introduction create interest in the topic and make your readers want to read more? (This will be covered in the next unit.)
3. Is your essay well organized? Did you use an outline or other tool to help with the organization?
4. Is the main idea of each paragraph clear? Have you developed each paragraph with supporting information?
5. How have you transitioned between paragraphs? Have you used key words and pronouns to create connections between sentences and paragraphs?
6. Are the sentences clear and well written? Have you varied your sentence structure? Could any sentences be improved by combining or rewriting them?
7. Is your vocabulary accurate? Have you used precise words to express your meaning?
8. Does your essay have a strong conclusion? Does it bring the essay to a satisfying close, and give your reader something to think about?

# Proofreading

Which of these sentences is correctly written for both meaning and grammar?

## Question 1

- When it comes to **eating people** (X) differ in their tastes.
- People are **differ** (X) when it comes to taste in eating.
- When it comes to eating, people differ in their preferences.

> The first choice lacks punctuation, so it could be interpreted to mean 'eating people'. The second is incrrect because 'differ' is a verb. It should either be 'people are different' or 'people differ.'


## Question 2

- My high scores on the exam positively affected my chance to get into a good university.
- My high scores on the exam positively effected my chance **getting** (X) into a good university.
- My high scores on the exam positively **affects** (X) my chance to get into a good university.

> The second sentence uses the wrong 'effect'. Effect is typically used as a noun. It is occasionally a verb meaning 'to bring about'. It's not often used, but when it is, it is typically in the phrase "to effect a change in something". It also uses the gerund (getting) incorrectly; it should be the infinitive 'to get' or the phrase 'of getting.' The last sentence has a subject-verb agreement problem.

## Question 3

- **There in** (X) Wheeler Auditorium will be a lecture on the causes of cancer.
- There will be a lecture **on the causes of cancer in Wheeler Auditorium** (X).
- There will be a lecture in Wheeler Auditorium on the causes of cancer. 

> The first sentence improperly puts the prepositional phrase, in Wheeler Auditorium, between "There" and the verb. The second sentence improperly puts the same phrase at the end, which implies that the **lecture will be about cancer as it occurs in Wheeler Auditorium**. Grammatically, it is correct, but it is unlikely that this would be the topic of a lecture.

## Question 4

- Corn is a widely planted genetically modified crop that is used to produce genetically modified food.
- Corn **is** (X) **planted** (X) widely genetically modified crop that is use to **produce** (X) genetically modified food.
- Corn is a widely planted **modified genetic** (X) crop **what** (X) is used to produce **modified genetic** (X) food.

>ã€€The second and third versions have word order problems. Compare it to the first sentence, which is correct. The second choice also has a problem with the past participle, which should be produced, not produce. It is also lacking an article. The third sentence uses 'what' incorrectly.
